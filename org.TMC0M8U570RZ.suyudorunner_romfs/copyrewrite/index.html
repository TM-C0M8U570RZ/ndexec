      <h1>CopyRewrite Proposal</h1>
      <h2>By Benjamin Mickle</h2>
      <p>To President Donald Trump and the United States Congress:</p>
      <p>Hello, this is Benjamin Mickle, resident of Illinois and lead developer of libTmcNnDetect and ndexec.<br />The reason I developed this DRM is to expose the problems with Digital Millennium Copyright Act and to propose a replacement which I have dubbed “CopyRewrite Act” or CRA for short.<br />DMCA has several unconstitutional components to it, such as the 1st-Amendment-violating Title 17 § 1201,<br />the very law which my DRM exploits and several other DRM solutions exploit, and the 5th- and 8th-Amendment-violating way in which DMCA is enforced.</p>
      <p>The reason I am targeting Nintendo Co., LTD with the design of my DRM is because they are the epitome of corporations that abuse these unconstitutional laws.<br />In 1985, Nintendo Co., LTD filed a patent for the very first game console DRM chip known as 10NES or CIC.<br />DMCA’s enactment in 1998 allowed Nintendo Co., LTD to basically abuse this patent in their lawsuits,<br />framing everything in terms of Title 17 § 1201 and with DMCA extending the life of a copyright to life of holder + 70 years, that copyright won’t expire until 2089, 70 years after John Kirby’s death.<br />This means these people will be able to continue abusing this one patent to bully individuals who can’t afford to fight back until probably after I’m dead.</p>
      <p>The proposed solution?  Break all connections with WIPO and form a new copyright system with fairness to the individuals in mind.  A list of changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Abandonware shall become public domain.</li>
        <li>Copyrights shall have a limit of 30 years of life.</li>
        <li>All transformative works shall be fair use regardless of whether they are SFW or NSFW and regardless of form (Edit, mod, fanart, fangame, fanfic, etc.)</li>
        <li>Circumvention without piracy or online cheating shall be exempt from anti-circumvention laws.</li>
        <li>The penalty for violating fair use shall be much greater than the penalty for infringing on an intellectual property.</li>
        <li>Due process in takedowns shall be a constitutional right.</li>
        <li>Corporation legal team size shall be limited to three individuals to make the alleged infringer stand a chance.</li>
        <li>Arbitration agreements shall be banned.</li>
        <li>Artificial intelligence shall be banned from detecting copyright infringement.</li>
      </ul>
