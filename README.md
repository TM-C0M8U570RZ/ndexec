# ndexec
Generate .mspcache files for libTmcMesprit and Soonâ„¢ .sydcache files for libTmcNnDetect
This is mostly a PoC for now.  libTmcNnDetect support coming Oct 24.  
Some changes in the letter are more to limit the power of company legal teams rather than to revise copyright law.  That's why a few seem out of place.  
## GITHUB DO NOT TAKE THIS DOWN!  YOU ALLOW ARTISTIC NUDITY JUST LIKE YOUTUBE AND HONOO'S PENIS IS PART OF THE SYMBOLISM IN HIS DESIGN AS HE IS INTENDED TO SYMBOLIZE LIBTMCNNDETECT PROTECTING NINTENDO FANART EVEN WHEN NSFW!!!!!
Visibility of the penis is disabled by default.  To enable it, run ndexec with `--honoo-rocket` for the canon design with a canine penis or `--honoo-mushroom` if you don't like animal cocks and want a human one.
You can even use `--soft` if you prefer a flaccid/sheathed penis.  
Honoo only appears if you pass the age verification anyway.
