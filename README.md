# ndexec
Some changes in the letter are more to limit the power of company legal teams rather than to revise copyright law.  That's why a few seem out of place.  
## GITHUB DO NOT TAKE THIS DOWN!  YOU ALLOW ARTISTIC NUDITY JUST LIKE YOUTUBE AND HONOO'S PENIS IS PART OF THE SYMBOLISM IN HIS DESIGN AS HE IS INTENDED TO SYMBOLIZE LIBTMCNNDETECT PROTECTING NINTENDO FANART EVEN WHEN NSFW!!!!!
Visibility of the penis is disabled by default.  To enable it, run ndexec with `--honoo-rocket` for the canon design with a canine penis or `--honoo-mushroom` if you don't like animal cocks and want a human one.
You can even use `--soft` if you prefer a flaccid/sheathed penis.  
Alternatively, you can edit the config file located at either `%APPDATA%\org.TMC0M8U570RZ.suyudorunner\config.btcf` or `~/.local/share/org.TMC0M8U570RZ.suyudorunner/config.btcf` to configure the program.  Use either btcf-edit or the btcf.fbs and flatc to set the penis_type key to the value "fox", "dog" or "canine" for canine penis or to "human" or "humanoid" for the human penis.  Set the "aroused" key to true if you want honoo's penis to be erect.  
Honoo only appears if you pass the age verification anyway.  
To build, you need to install tmcSdk.  Prebuilt deb can be found here: https://github.com/TM-C0M8U570RZ/libTmcSdkCore/releases
